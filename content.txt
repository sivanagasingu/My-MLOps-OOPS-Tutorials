    > Code Walkthrough
    > attriubutes are get called itself, methods are called manually
3. Why Python is called OOP? - everything in python is object (data structure, data type etc.)
4. Advantages of OOPS concept:
    > You can create your own datatype
    > code re-usability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab

5. End to End project (Chatbook class)
    > function vs method
    > magic method and dunder method
    > Self
    > You can create attribute outside the class as well

    > encapsulation
    > getter and setter
    > static method
